# How to prevent it?

This API documentation smell can be prevented by first outlining who your audience will be. If your audience is mainly developers (as it usually is), you should keep in mind the circumstances that your audience will be in, when they read your documentation.

If they are developers, and they are looking at your documentation, they must be trying to figure something out about your API. If you put yourself in their shoes, you would like answers to your problems, fairly quickly, and without much fuss.

With this in mind, you should keep your API documentation as concise as possible, while making sure that you **do not omit any crucial details that would hinder the usage or understanding of your API.**
