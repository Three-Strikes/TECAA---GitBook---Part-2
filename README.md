# What is it?

This API Documentation smell can be identified by extensive and verbose text, describing any API element, such as an endpoint, a request, or a response. This causes the documentation to be:

1. Hard to read;
2. Hard to follow, given the overflow of information that the reader has to parse;
3. Very hard to maintain, as any alteration to the code behind the API, would result in huge chunks of text having to be reworked on that specific element.

If your API suffers from these symptoms, you might want to scale back how much information you publish about your API, leaving only the necessary you feel is needed to use the API correctly.
