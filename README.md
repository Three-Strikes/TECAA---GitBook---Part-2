# What is it?

This API documentation smell is characterized by long and verbose descriptions for a single API element. These elements can include any part of an API, such as endpoints or examples within those endpoints.

This smell often renders the API documentation unusable due to the following reasons:

* **Slow and Hard to Read:** The excessive length makes it difficult to quickly understand the content.
* **Overwhelming Information:** Too much information for one element makes it hard to parse and follow.
* **Maintainability:** Frequent changes to APIs become challenging to manage due to the extensive details that need updating.

If your documentation exhibits these issues, consider scaling back the information you provide. Focus on including only the absolutely necessary details needed to use your API effectively.
